# Fielduino

AVR signal generator

Generates a PWM signal on pin 9 (Arduino Uno/Nano) using hardware timmers and ArduinoMenu library for frequency and dutty cycle control.

The Clock divider is choosen for the best result in terms of nearest frequency.

The menu is draw on serial monitor but ArduinoMenu can put it on many other devices.

## Dependencies
